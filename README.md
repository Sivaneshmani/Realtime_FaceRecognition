**Realtime Face Recognition Project**

**Description:**
This repository contains a Realtime Face Recognition project under development. The project aims to recognize faces in real-time using computer vision techniques and deep learning models. Please note that this project is still a work in progress, and improvements and updates may be added regularly.

**Setup Instructions:**

1. **Clone the Repository:** Start by cloning this repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/prakash02100/Realtime_FaceRecognition.git
   ```

2. **Create a Folder for Images:** In order to train and test the face recognition system, you need to create a folder called "images" inside the project directory. This folder will store the images of individuals that the model will recognize. Place images of each person in separate subfolders inside the "images" folder, with the name of the subfolder being the person's name or ID.

3. **Background Image:** Additionally, please ensure you have a suitable background image or video (e.g., a webcam feed) to test the real-time face recognition functionality.

**Project Development:**
As mentioned earlier, this project is currently under development, and certain functionalities may not be fully implemented or optimized. You are encouraged to check the repository regularly for updates and improvements. If you encounter any issues or have suggestions, feel free to open an issue in the repository or submit a pull request with your proposed changes.

**Contributing:**
Contributions to the project are welcome! If you have ideas for enhancing the project or implementing new features, please fork the repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request.

**Disclaimer:**
This project may contain bugs, incomplete features, or unoptimized code due to its development status. Use it at your own risk, and we recommend avoiding deploying it in critical or production environments until it reaches a stable version.

**Contact:**
If you have any questions or need assistance with the project, you can contact the project owner, Prakash, by opening an issue in the repository.

Thank you for showing interest in this Realtime Face Recognition project! We hope you find it useful and contribute to its progress. Happy coding!
